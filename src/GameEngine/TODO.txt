- Terrain builder should produce a 'Terrain' object which consists of the nav mesh/grid, the actual image of the map, and the colliders for the unpassable areas
- Make ITerrainSpec interface with getSpec() and cellSize prop.
- Refactor levelspec and IMapCell?
- Use maps in ITerrainSpec to map floor tile/wall/whatever to an array of possible sprites (for more diverse). All stats same except image
- Use this when building the image to get more randomized flooring
