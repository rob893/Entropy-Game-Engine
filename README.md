# Entropy Game Engine
Custom game engine for browsers written in TypeScript. Modeled after the Unity game engine.
Assets for the sample game are from opengameart.org and itch.io.

- If using webpack, use the `source-map-loader` dev dependency to load the source maps for local development.

## Getting Started
The best way to get started is to use the Entropy CLI.

- Install the CLI `npm i -g @entropy-engine/entropy-cli`
- Run `entropy init` and follow the interactive prompts to create your project
